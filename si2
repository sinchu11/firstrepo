the recent Uttar Pradesh Lok Sabha elections, Ayodhya played a significant role as a campaign plank.
The BJP candidate, Lallu Singh, sought a third term from Ayodhya, emphasizing the construction 
of the Ram Mandir on the site of the Babri mosque. This resonated with millions across the country and
became a key focus during the election1. However, despite Ayodhya’s prominence, the BJP candidate lost in the
Faizabad constituency, prompting Congress leader Pramod Tiwari to remark that the BJP is the “Vyapari” (trader) 
of Lord Ram, not the “Pujari” (priest)2. Tiwari also asserted that the NDA’s victory was due to the coalition, not 
solely because of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s popularity2. The Ram Mandir issue did not yield significant political
dividends for the BJP in Uttar Pradesh, where its seat tally decreased from 62 in 2019 to 35 in 2024, while the INDIA 
alliance secured 44 seats2. Akhilesh Yadav, leader of the INDIA alliance, celebrated this as a victory for the people of
Uttar Pradesh and their commitment to equality, respect, and reservation2.
